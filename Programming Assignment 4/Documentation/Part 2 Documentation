Program Description:
For part two this program implements the Google PageRank algorithm based on a stochastic matrix. The input is an N x N matrix representing the connection between webpages.
The program outputs the eigenvector for the webpages and a ranking of webpages based on their importance.

Approach: 
1. Matrix Processing:
The program reads the input matrix, ensuring it is stochastic and contains non-negative elements.
It checks for invalid input and outputs an error message if needed.

2. Power Method:
The power method is used to find the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed using the Accord.NET library.

3. Output Generation:
The program outputs the eigenvector for the webpages and the ranking of webpages from highest to lowest importance.

Resources and Libraries: 
The Accord.NET library is used for the eigenvalue decomposition.

Notes
The program outputs "Invalid input" if the input matrix is not valid.
