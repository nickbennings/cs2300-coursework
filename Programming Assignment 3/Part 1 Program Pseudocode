Part 1 - Leontief Input-Output Model

Read input matrix D from a file
Read external demand matrix E from a file

Compute matrix (I - D)
Compute the inverse of (I - D) using Gauss-Jordan elimination

Multiply the inverse matrix by the external demand matrix to get the output matrix X

Round each element of the output matrix to the nearest tenth

Print the output matrix X
