Question #1:
Why does this plaintext matrix have to be made up of column vectors of 4 elements?

Answer #1: 
The plaintext matrix in the provided encryption method is structured as column vectors of four elements mostly for simplicity and consistency. There are several reasons for 
this, the first being matrix multiplication. The encryption process involves multiplying the plaintext matrix with a specific encoding matrix. To perform this matrix
multiplication, the plaintext matrix needs to have a consistent number of columns that matches the number of rows in the matrix. The next reason is padding. When 
coding a message, it's sometimes likely that the number of characters in the message is not a multiple of four. To handle this, padding with zeros is used to complete the last
column vector. This ensures that the plaintext matrix maintains its four-column structure. Also, there is simplicity, with is a reason as well since using a fixed column size
simplifies the encryption and decryption processes. It provides a clear and consistent structure for both encoding and decoding, making the algorithm more straightforward. 
Lastly, uniformity is also obtained when using four-element column vectors too. Each part of the message can be consistently mapped to a corresponding element in the plaintext matrix.
This uniformity simplifies the mapping process from characters to numeric values and back. Overall, using column vectors of four elements in the plaintext matrix ensures that the 
encryption and decryption process is well-defined, consistent, and compatible with the chosen encoding matrix. It provides a clear structure for handling messages of different lengths
while maintaining the integrity of the encryption algorithm too.
