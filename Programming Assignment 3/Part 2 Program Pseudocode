Part 2 - Least Squares Regression Analysis

Read data points (x, y) from a file

Create a matrix X with the first column as 1 (constant term) and the second column as x values

Create a matrix Y with the y values

Transpose matrix X

Multiply transposed X by X to get X^T * X

Compute the inverse of X^T * X

Multiply the inverse by X^T

Multiply the result by Y to get matrix A

Round the elements of matrix A to the nearest tenth

Print the least squares regression line equation: Y = A[0,0] + A[1,0] * x

Export data points and the regression line equation to a CSV file for external plotting
