Program Description:
The Part 1 program operates on points, lines, and planes. It processes input data that defines planes and points, computing the distance between each point and its corresponding plane. 
Also, it checks for intersections between a given line and a set of triangles in 3D-space.

Approach:
1. Distance Calculation:
For each line of input, the program calculates the distance between a point and a plane using linear algebra operations.
The plane is defined by a point on the plane, the normal vector, and the coordinates of the point.
The distance calculation involves dot products and vector normalization.

2. Intersection Checking:
The program determines if a line intersects with a triangle in 3D-space.
It goes through the vertices of each triangle and checks for intersections using vector operations.
If an intersection is found, the program outputs the coordinates of the intersection point; otherwise, it outputs "Does not intersect."

Resources and Libraries:
No external libraries were used.
